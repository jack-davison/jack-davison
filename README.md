## 🚗 Who am I?
**I am a PhD Student in atmospheric chemistry at the [Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories](https://www.york.ac.uk/chemistry/research/wacl/) at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/) in the United Kingdom, investigating how emissions from road transport impact the air we breathe.** As part of my work I delve into extremely large data sets of road-side data, which I accomplish primarily using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) in the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) IDE, with a focus on the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite of R packages and the dedicated air quality analysis package [`{openair}`](https://davidcarslaw.github.io/openair). When exploring data, I commonly employ [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for reproducible data analysis.

As well as developing my own R code to solve the data challenges I face, I have supported and taught colleagues R and developed my own self-teaching R materials to assist new users through reading, manipulating and visualising data inside of an R environment. I have used these materials to teach introduction sessions to both PhD students and air quality professionals.

## 📢 My Publications
The publications I have been involved in so far can be viewed on my [ORCID iD page](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2653-6615). All focus on the use of the *Vehicle Emissions Remote Sensing* technique to measure emissions from road transport, and the unique insights they can provide that in-lab or on-board techniques cannot. They were written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org//), a plain-text document preparation system, using the online editor [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

## 📊 Data Visualisation
In my spare time, I enjoy developing my R and data visualisation skills through the [#TidyTuesday Project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a weekly data science challenge to both wrangle and visualise an unseen, "real-world" data set. You can view all of my visualisations and the code used to create them in their [dedicated repository](https://github.com/jack-davison/TidyTuesday). Let me know what you think over Twitter - I'm [`@JDavison`](https://twitter.com/JDavison_)!
