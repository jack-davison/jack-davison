## 🚗 Who am I 
I am a PhD Student in atmospheric chemistry in at the [Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories](https://www.york.ac.uk/chemistry/research/wacl/) at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/) in the United Kingdom, investigating how emissions from road transport impacts the air we breathe. As part of my work I must delve into extremely large data sets of roadside data, which I accomplish primarily using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) in the [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) IDE, with a focus on the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite of R packages. As well as developing my own code to solve the data challenges I face, I have supported and taught collegaues R and developed my own self-learning R materials to assist new users.
